# Pandas_Heroes-of-Pymoli
### This is a project where analyses were done on the purchases occurred in the game of Heros of Pymoli. Purchasing analyses were carried out based on gender and age. Analyses were also done to figure out the top spenders, the most popular items, and the most profitable items. Three conclusions were drawn based on the analysis. ###
# Please open the Jupyter Notebook to see the analyses. Note that github seems to have trouble displaying contents of some of the tables.
